# ate - awesome terminal emulator

Is my personal terminal emulator tailor made for what I need and just what I need. 

Goals:
  - Work on X11
  - Work on Wayland without XWayland
  - Scrollback
  - Reflow
  - Emoji support
  - Font resizing with ctrl-shift-plus/ctrl-shift-minus

Non-Goals:
   - Parsing configuration files
   - Other keybindings
   - Other colors


The application is trivial and maintaing your custom patch on top of this is
likewise. I do not intend to change a lot nor do I promisve compatibility with
any of your changes.
